\section{Introduction}

In this paper, we will provide a rigid analytic construction of the deformation to the normal cone, studied in \cite{Gaitsgory_Study_II}.
Our goal is to use this geometric construction to deduce certain important results concerning both \emph{rigid analytic} and
\emph{over-convergent} (Hodge complete)
\emph{derived de Rham cohomology} of rigid analytic spaces over a non-archimedean field of characteristic zero.
We will then exploit this ideas to come up with analogues concerning \emph{derived rigid cohomology} of finite type schemes over a perfect field
in characteristic zero. In particular, our main goal is to extrapolate the main result of \cite{Bhatt_Derived_Completions} to the setting of
derived rigid cohomology.

\subsection{Preliminaries}
Let $\cX$ be an \inftopos. The notion of a \emph{local $\cTank$-structure on $\cX$} was first introduced in \cite[Definition 2.4]{Porta_Yu_Derived_non-archimedean_analytic_spaces},
see also \cite[\S 2]{antonio2018p}.

Let  $\cO \in \Strloc_{\cTank}(\cX)$ be a local $\cTank$-structure on $\cX$. Since the pregeometry $\cTank$ is compatible
with $n$-truncations, cf. \cite[Theorem 3.23]{Porta_Yu_Derived_non-archimedean_analytic_spaces}, it follows that
$\pi_0(\cO) \in \Strloc_{\cTank}(\cX)$, as well.

Denote by $\cJ \subseteq \pi_0(\cO)$, the \emph{Jacobson ideal} of $\pi_0(\cO \alg)$, which can be naturally regarded as an object
in the \infcat
    \[
        \Mod_{\pi_0(\cO \alg)} \simeq \Mod_{\pi_0(\cO)},  
    \]
for a justification of the latter equivalence, see for instance \cite[Theorem 4.5]{Porta_Yu_Representability} .
Since the \infcat $\Str_{\cTank}(\cX)$ is a presentable \infcat we can consider the quotient
    \[
        \pi_0(\cO)_\red \coloneqq \pi_0(\cO)/\cJ \in \Str_{\cTank}(\cX)  ,
    \]
which we refer to the \emph{reduced $\cTank$-structure on $\cX$ associated to $\pi_0(\cO)$}. Moreover, the corresponding \emph{underlying algebra} satisfies
    \[(\pi_0(\cO)_{\red})\alg \simeq \pi_0(\cO)\alg/ \cJ \in \Str_{\cTdisck}(\cX).\]
One can further prove that
$\pi_0(\cO)_\red \in \Str_{\cTank}(\cX)$ actually lies in the full subcategory $\Strloc_{\cTank}(\cX)$.

\begin{defin}
    Let $Z = (\cZ, \cO_Z) \in \RTop(\cTan(k))$ denote a $\cTank$-structured \inftopos. We define the \emph{reduced $\cTank$-structure \inftopos} as
        \[
            Z_\red \coloneqq (\cZ, \pi_0(\cO_Z)_\red) \in \RTop(\cTank).
        \]
    We shall denote by $\Afd_k^\red$ (resp., $\Ank^\red$) the full subcategory of $\dAfd_k$ (resp., $\dAnk$)
    spanned by reduced $k$-affinoid (resp., $k$-analytic spaces).
\end{defin}

\begin{notation}
    Let $(-)^\red \colon \dAnk \to \Ank^\red$ denote the functor obtained by the formula
        \[
            Z = (\cZ, \cO_Z) \in \dAnk\mapsto Z_\red = (\cZ, \pi_0(\cZ)_\red) \in \Ank^\red.
        \]
    We shall refer to it as the \emph{underlying reduced $k$-analytic space}.
\end{notation}

\begin{lem}
    Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a Zariski open immersion of derived $k$-analytic spaces. Then $f^\red \colon X^\red \to Y^\red$ is also
    a Zariski open immersion.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    By the definitions, it is clear that the truncation
        \[
            \trunc(f) \colon \trunc(X) \to \trunc(Y),  
        \]
    is a Zariski open immersion of ordinary $k$-analytic spaces. In the case of ordinary $k$-analytic spaces it is clear from the construction
    that the reduction of Zariski open immersions is again a Zariski open immersion.
\end{proof}

\begin{defin}
    In \cite[Definition 5.41]{Porta_Yu_Representability} the authors introduced the notion of a square-zero extension between $\cTank$-structured
    \inftopoi. In particular, given a morphism $f \colon Z \to Z'$ in $\RTop(\cTank)$, we shall say that $f$ \emph{has the structure of
    a square-zero extension} if $f$ exhibits $Z'$ as a square-zero extension of $Z$.
\end{defin}

Recall the definition of the \infcats of derived $k$-affinoid and derived $k$-analytic spaces given
in \cite[Definition 7.3 and Definition 2.5.]{Porta_Yu_Derived_non-archimedean_analytic_spaces}, respectively.

\begin{rem} \label{rem:construction_of_nilpotent_extensions_as_square_zero_extensions}
    Let $X \in \Ank$. Let $\cJ \subseteq \cO_X$ be an ideal satisfying $\cJ^2 = 0$. Consider the fiber sequence
        \[
            \cJ \to \cO_X \to \cO_X/\cJ,  
        \]
    in the \infcat $\Coh^+(X)$. It corresponds to a well defined morphism $d \colon \cO_X / \cJ \to \cJ[1]$ admitting $\cO_X$ as fiber. The morphism $d$ defines
    a derivation $d \colon \bbL\an_{\cO_X/ \cJ} \to \cJ[1]$, by pre-composing with the natural map $\cO_X/ \cJ \to \bbL\an_{\cO_X/ \cJ}$.
    In particular, we can consider the square-zero extension of $\cO_X$ by $\cJ$ induced by $\cJ$ defined by $d$. The latter object
    must then be equivalent to $\cO_X$ itself. We conclude that $\cO_X$ is a square-zero extension of $\cO_X/\cJ$.
\end{rem}

\begin{lem} \label{lem:derived_k_analytic_space_whose_reduction_is_affinoid_is_also_affinoid}
    Let $Z \coloneqq (\cZ, \cO_Z) \in \RTop(\cTank)$ denote a $\cTank$-structure \inftopos. Suppose that the reduction
    $Z_\red$ is equivalent to a derived $k$-affinoid space. Then the truncation $\trunc(Z)$ is isomorphic to an ordinary $k$-affinoid space.
    If we assume further that for every $i>0$, the homotopy sheaves $\pi_i(\cO_Z)$ are
    coherent $\pi_0(\cO_Z)$-modules, then $Z$ itself is equivalent to a derived $k$-affinoid space.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof} We first observe that the second claim of the Lemma follows readily from the first one. We thus are thus reduced to prove that $\trunc(Z)$ is isomorphic to an ordinary $k$-affinoid space.
    Let $\cJ \subseteq \pi_0(\cO_Z)$, denote the coherent ideal sheaf associated to the closed immersion $Z_\red \hookrightarrow Z$. Notice that the ideal $\cJ$
    agrees with the Jacobson ideal of $\pi_0(\cO_Z)$. Since derived $k$-analytic spaces are Noetherian, it follows that there exists
    a sufficiently large integer $n \ge 2$ such that
        \[
            \cJ^n = 0.  
        \]
    Arguing by induction we can suppose that $n = 2$, that is to say that
        \[\cJ^2 = 0.\]
    In particular, \cref{rem:construction_of_nilpotent_extensions_as_square_zero_extensions} implies that the above map has
    the natural morphism $Z_\red \to Z$ has the structure of a square zero extension.
    The assertion now follows from \cite[Proposition 6.1]{Porta_Yu_Representability}
    and its proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
    We observe that the converse of \cref{lem:derived_k_analytic_space_whose_reduction_is_affinoid_is_also_affinoid} holds true.
    Indeed, the natural morphism $Z_\red \to Z$ is a closed immersion. In particular, if $Z \in \dAfd_k$ we deduce readily from
    that $Z_\red \in \dAfd_k$, as well.
\end{rem}

\begin{defin}
    Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a morhpism in the \infcat $\dAnk$. We shall say that $f$ is an \emph{affine morphism} if
    for every morphism $Z \to Y$ in $\dAnk$ such that $Z$ is equivalent to a derived $k$-affinoid space, the pullback
        \[
            Z' \coloneqq Z \times_Y X \in \dAnk,  
        \]
    is also equivalent to a derived $k$-affinoid space.
\end{defin}

\begin{notation}
    Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a morphism of derived $k$-analytic spaces. We shall denote by
        \[
            f^\# \colon \cO_Y \to f_* \cO_X,
        \]  
    the induced morphism at the level of $\cTank$-structures.
\end{notation}

\begin{lem} \label{lem:affine_morphisms_are_compatible_with_Zariski_localization_on_the_base}
    Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be an affine morphism in $\dAn_k$. Suppose that we are given a Zariski open immersion
    $g \colon Z \to Y$ such that $Z \in \dAfdk$ which corresponds to the completement of the zero locus of a
    section $s \in \pi_0(\cO_Y)$. Then the fiber product
        \[
            Z' \coloneqq Z \times_Y X \in \dAn_k,  
        \]
    is equivalent to a derived $k$-affinoid space and moreover $\Gamma(Z', \cO_{Z'}\alg) \simeq B[1/f^\#(s)]$, where
    $B \coloneqq \Gamma(X, \cO_X\alg)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof} The first assertion of the Lemma follows readily from the definition of affine morphisms.
    We shall now prove the second claim. Let $A \coloneqq \Gamma(Y, \cO_Y\alg)$. In this case, we have a natural equivalence of
    derived $k$-algebras
        \[
            A[1/f] \simeq \Gamma(Z, \cO_Z\alg).  
        \]
    Since Zariski open immersions are stable under pullbacks, it follows that the natural morphism $g' \colon Z' \to X$ is itself a Zariski
    open immersion. In particular, it follows that we can identify
        \[
            \Gamma(Z', \cO_{Z'}) \simeq B[1/t],
        \]
    where $t \in \pi_0(B)$. In order to conclude the proof, we observe that the $0$-th truncation, $\trunc(g)$, is again a Zariski
    open immersion. For this reason, one should have forcibly that $t = f^\#(s)$, by the universal
    property of fiber products of ordinary $k$-analytic spaces.
\end{proof}


\section{Non-archimedean differential geometry}

\subsection{Analytic formal moduli problems under a base}
In this \S, we will study the notion of \emph{analytic formal moduli problems under} a fixed derived $k$-analytic space. The
results presented here will prove to be crucial for the study of the deformation to the normal cone in the $k$-analytic
setting, presented in the next section.
We start with the following definition:

\begin{defin}
    Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a morphism in $\dAnk$. We say that $f$ is a \emph{nil-isomorphism} if $f_\red \colon X_\red \to
    Y_\red$ is an isomorphism of $k$-analytic spaces. We denote by $\anNil_{/ X}$ the full subcategory of $(\dAnk)^{\mathrm{ft}}_{X/}$
    spanned by nil-isomorphisms $X \to Y$ of finite type.
\end{defin}

\begin{lem} \label{lem:nil-isos_are_affine_morphisms}
    Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a nil-isomorphism in $\dAnk$. Then:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Given any morphism $Z \to Y$ in $\dAnk$, the induced morphism
            \[
                Z \times_X Y \to Z,  
            \]
        is again an nil-isomoprhism.
        \item $f$ is an affine morphism.
        \item $f$ is a finite morphism.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof} To prove (i), it suffices to prove that
    the functor $(\textrm{-})^\red \colon \dAnk \to \Ank^{\red}$ commutes with finite limits. The truncation functor
        \[
            \trunc \colon \dAnk \to \Ank,  
        \]
    commutes with finite limits. So we further reduce ourselves to the prove that the usual underlying reduced functor
        \[
            (-)^\red \colon \Ank \to \Ank^\red,
        \]
    commutes with finite limits. By construction,
    the latter assertion is equivalent to the claim that
    the complete tensor product of ordinary $k$-affinoid algebras commutes with the operation of taking the quotient by the Jacobson radical, which is immediate.

    We now prove (ii). Let $Z \to Y$ be a Zariski open immersion such that $Z$ is a derived $k$-affinoid space. Then we claim that the pullback
    $Z \times_X Y$ is again a derived $k$-affinoid space. Thanks to \cref{lem:derived_k_analytic_space_whose_reduction_is_affinoid_is_also_affinoid}
    we reduced to prove that $(Z \times_X Y)_\red$ is equivalent to an
    ordinary $k$-affinoid space. Thanks to (i), we deduce that the induced morphism
        \[
            (Z \times_X Y)_\red \to Z_\red,  
        \]
    is an isomorphism of ordinary $k$-analytic spaces. In particular, $(Z \times_X Y)_\red$ is a $k$-affinoid space. The result now follows from
    \cref{lem:derived_k_analytic_space_whose_reduction_is_affinoid_is_also_affinoid}.

    To prove (iii), we shall show that the induced morphism on the $0$-th truncations $\trunc(X) \to \trunc(Y)$ is a finite morphism of ordinary $k$-affinoid spaces.
    But this follows immeaditely from the fact that both $\trunc(X)$ and $\trunc(Y)$ can be obtained from the reduced $X_\red$ by means of a finite sequence of finite
    coherent $X_\red$-modules.
\end{proof}


\begin{defin}
    A morphism $X \to Y$ be a morphism in $\dAnk$ is called a \emph{nil-embedding} if the induced map of ordinary $k$-analytic spaces
    $\trunc(X) \to \trunc(Y)$ is a closed immersion, such that the ideal of $\trunc(X)$ in $\trunc(Y)$ is nilpotent. 
\end{defin}

\begin{prop} \label{prop:filtered_colimit_for_nil-embeddings}
    Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a nil-embedding of derived $k$-analytic spaces. Then there exists a sequence of morphisms
        \[X = X_0^0 \hookrightarrow X_0^1 \hookrightarrow \dots \hookrightarrow X_0^n = X_0 
        \hookrightarrow X_1 \dots X_n \hookrightarrow \dots \hookrightarrow Y,\]
    such that for each $0 \le i \le n$ the morphism $X_0^i \hookrightarrow X_0^{i+1}$ has the structure of a square zero extension.
    Similarly, for every $i \ge 0$, the morphism $X_i \hookrightarrow X_{i+1}$ has the structure of a square-zero extension.
    Furthermore, the induced morphisms $\mathrm{t}_{\le i}(X_i) \to \mathrm{t}_{\le i}(Y)$ are equivalences of derived
    $k$-analytic spaces.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    The proof follows the same scheme of reasoning as of \cite[Proposition 5.5.3]{Gaitsgory_Study_II}. For the sake of completeness we present the complete here.
    Consider the induced morphism on the underlying truncations
        \[
            \trunc(f) \colon \trunc(X) \to \trunc(Y).   
        \]
    By construction, there exists a sufficiently large integer $n \ge 0$ such that
        \[
            \cJ^{n+1} = 0,  
        \]
    where $\cJ \subseteq \pi_0(\cO_Y)$ denotes the ideal associated to the nil-embedding $\trunc(f)$.
    Therefore, we can factor the latter as a finite sequence of square-zero extensions of ordinary $k$-analytic spaces
        \[
            \trunc(X) \hookrightarrow X_0^{\mathrm{ord}, 0} \hookrightarrow \dots \hookrightarrow X^{\mathrm{ord}, n}_0 = \trunc(Y),
        \]
    as in the proof of \cref{lem:derived_k_analytic_space_whose_reduction_is_affinoid_is_also_affinoid}. For each $0 \le i \le n$, we set
        \[
            X_0^i \coloneqq X \bigsqcup_{\trunc(X)} X_0^{\mathrm{ord}, i}.
        \]
    By construction, we have that the natural morphism $\trunc(X_0^n) \to \trunc(Y)$ is an isomorphism of ordinary $k$-analytic spaces.
    We now argue by induction on the Postnikov towers associated to the morphism $f \colon X \to Y$.
    Suppose that for a certain integer $i \ge 0$, we have constructed a derived $k$-analytic space $X_i$ together with morphisms $g_i \colon
    X \to X_i$ and $h_i \colon X_i \to Y$ such that $f \simeq h_i \circ g_i$
    and the induced morphism
        \[
            \mathrm{t}_{\le i}(X_i) \to \mathrm{t}_{\le i}(Y)
        \]
    is an equivalence of derived $k$-analytic spaces. We shall proceed as follows: by the assumption that $h_i$ is $(i+1)$-connective, we deduce from
    \cite[Proposition 5.34]{Porta_Yu_Representability} the existence of a natural equivalence
        \[
            \tau_{\le i}(\bbL_{X_i/Y}\an) \simeq 0,
        \]
    in $\Mod_{\cO_{X_i}}$. Consider the natural fiber sequence
        \[
            h_i^* \bbL\an_{Y} \to \bbL\an_{X_i} \to \bbL\an_{X_i/Y},
        \]
    in $\Mod_{\cO_{X_i}}$. The natural morphism
        \[
            \bbL\an_{X_i/ Y} \to \pi_{i+1}(\bbL\an_{X_i/Y})[i+1],  
        \]
    induces a morphism $\bbL\an_{X_i} \to \pi_{i+1}(\bbL\an_{X_i/Y})[i+1]$, such that the composite
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:fiber_sequence_of_cotangent_complexes_to_produce_the_existence_of_the_desired_square_zero_extension_approximating_Y_in_degree_i+1}
            h_i^* \bbL\an_{Y} \to \bbL\an_{X_i} \to \pi_{i+1}(\bbL\an_{X_i/Y}),  
        \end{equation}
    is null-homotopic, in $\Mod_{\cO_{X_i}}$. The existence of
    \eqref{eq:fiber_sequence_of_cotangent_complexes_to_produce_the_existence_of_the_desired_square_zero_extension_approximating_Y_in_degree_i+1}
    produces a square-zero extension
        \[
            X_i  \to X_{i+1},
        \]
    together with a morphism $h_{i+1} \colon X_{i+1} \to Y$, factoring $h_i \colon X_i \to Y$. We  are reduced to show that the morphism
        \[
            \cO_Y \to h_{i+1, *}(\cO_{X_{i+1}}), 
        \]
    is $(i+2)$-connective. Consider the commutative diagram
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:commutative_diagram_of_fiber_sequences_exhibiting_O_X_i+1_as_an_approximation_of_level_i+1_of_Y}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            h_{i, *}(\pi_{i+1}(\bbL\an_{X_i/Y}))[i] \ar{r} & h_{i+1, *}(\cO_{X_{i+1}}) \ar{r} & h_{i, *}(\cO_{X_i}) \\
            \cI \ar{r} \ar{u}{s_i} & \cO_Y \ar{r} \ar{u} & h_*(\cO_{X_i}) \ar{u} \\
            \cJ \ar{r} \ar{u} & \cJ \ar{r} \ar{u} & 0 \ar{u}
        \end{tikzcd},
        \end{equation}
    where both the vertical and horizontal composites are fiber sequences. Thanks to \cite[Proposition 5.34]{Porta_Yu_Representability} we can identify the natural
    morphism    
        \[
           s_i \colon \cI \to h_{i, *}(\pi_{i+1}(\bbL\an_{X_i/Y}))[i]
        \]
    with the natural morphism $\cI \to \tau_{\ge i}(I)$. We deduce that the fiber of the morphism $s_i$ must be necessarily $(i+1)$-connective. The latter observation
    combined with the structure of \eqref{eq:commutative_diagram_of_fiber_sequences_exhibiting_O_X_i+1_as_an_approximation_of_level_i+1_of_Y}
    implies that $h_{i+1} \colon X_{i+1} \to Y$ induces an equivalence of derived $k$-analytic spaces
        \[
            \rt_{\le i+1}(X_{i+1}) \to \rt_{\le i+1}(Y),  
        \]
    as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
    Let $X \in \dAnk$. Then the natural morphism
        \[
            X_\red \to X,  
        \]
    in $\dAnk$, can be \emph{approximated} by successive square zero extensions.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
    The assertion of the Corollary follows readily from \cref{prop:filtered_colimit_for_nil-embeddings} by observing that the
    canonical morphism $X_\red \to X$ has the structure of a nil-embedding.
\end{proof}


\begin{lem} \label{lem:f^*_admits_a_right_adjoint_whenever_f_is_nil-iso}
    Let $f \colon S \to S'$ be a nil-isomorphism between derived $k$-analytic spaces. Then the pullback functor
        \[
            f^* \colon \Coh^+(S') \to \Coh^+(S),  
        \]
    admits a well defined right adjoint, $f_*$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Since $f \colon S \to S'$ is a nil-isomorphism, we conclude from \cref{lem:nil-isos_are_affine_morphisms} that $f$ is an affine morphism
    between derived $k$-analytic spaces. By Zariski descent of $\Coh^+$, cf. \cite[Theorem 3.7]{Antonio_Porta_Nonarchimedean_Hilbert},
    together with \cref{lem:affine_morphisms_are_compatible_with_Zariski_localization_on_the_base} we reduce the statement of the Lemma to the case
    where both $S$ and $S'$ are equivalent to derived $k$-affinoid spaces. In this case, by Tate acyclicity theorem we reduce ourselves
    to show that the usual base change functor
        \[
           f^* \colon  \Coh^+(A) \to \Coh^+(B)  ,
        \]
    where $A \coloneqq \Gamma(S, \cO_S \alg)$ and $B \coloneqq \Gamma(S', \cO_{S'} \alg)$, admits a right adjoint. The result now follows from the observation
    that the canonical induced morphism $\pi_0(A) \to \pi_0(B)$ is a finite morphism of ordinary rings. Indeed, the latter morphism can be obtained
    by means of a finite sequence of (classical) square-zero extensions with respect to the corresponding Jacobson ideals of both $\pi_0(A)$ and $\pi_0(B)$.
    Such ideals are necessarily finitely generated as $\pi_0(A)$-modules, and the result follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem} \label{lem:pushouts_of_square_zero_extensions_have_the_structure_of_a_square_zero_extension}
    Let $f \colon S \to S'$ be a square-zero extension and $g \colon S \to T$ a nil-isomorphism in $\dAnk$. Suppose we are given a pushout diagram
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            S \ar{r}{f} \ar{d} & S' \ar{d} \\
            T \ar{r} & T'  
        \end{tikzcd},
        \]
    in $\dAnk$. Then the induced morphism $T \to T'$ is a square-zero extension.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Since $g$ is a nil-isomorphism of derived $k$-analytic spaces, \cref{lem:f^*_admits_a_right_adjoint_whenever_f_is_nil-iso}
    implies that the pullback functor $g^* \colon \Coh^+(T) \to \Coh^+(S)$ admits a well defined right adjoint
        \[
            g_* \colon \Coh^+(S ) \to \Coh^+(T) .
        \]
    Let $\cF \in \Coh^+(S)^{\ge 0}$ and $d \colon \bbL\an_S \to \cF$ be a derivation
    associated with the morphism $f \colon S \to S'$. Consider now the natural composite
        \[
            d ' \colon \bbL\an_T \to g_* (\bbL\an_S) \xrightarrow{g_*(d)} g_* (\cF),  
        \]
    in the \infcat $\Coh^+(T)$. By the universal property of the analytic cotangent complex, we deduce the existence of a square-zero extension
        \[
            T \to T',  
        \]
    in the \infcat $\dAnk$. Let $X \in \dAnk$ together with morphisms $S' \to X$ and $T \to X$ compatible with both $f$ and $g$. By the universal property of
    the relative analytic cotangent complex, the morphism $S' \to X$ induces a uniquely defined (up to a contractible indeterminacy space)
        \[
            \bbL\an_{S/X} \to \cF,
        \]
    in $\Coh^+(S)$, such that the compositve $\bbL\an_S \to \bbL\an_{S/X} \to \cF$ agrees with $d$. By applying the right adjoint $g_*$ above we obtain a
    commutative diagram
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \bbL\an_T \ar{r}{\mathrm{can}} \ar{d} & \bbL\an_{T/X} \ar{d} \ar{rd}{d''} & \\
            g_*(\bbL\an_S) \ar{r} & g_*(\bbL\an_{S/X}) \ar{r} & g_*(\cF),
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    in the \infcat $\Coh^+(T)$. From this, we conclude again by the universal property of the relative analytic cotangent complex the existence
    of a natural morphism $T' \to X$ extending both $T \to X$ and $S' \to X$ and compatible with the restriction to $S$. The latter assertion is equivalent to state
    that the commutative square
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            S \ar{r} \ar{d} & S' \ar{d} \\
            T \ar{r} & T',
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    is a pushout diagram in $\dAnk$. The proof is thus concluded.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop} \label{prop:existence_of_pushouts_along_closed_nil-isomorphisms}
    Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a nil-embedding of derived $k$-analytic spaces. Let
    $g \colon X \to Z$ be a finite morphism in $\dAnk$. The the diagram
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            X \ar{r}{f} \ar{d}{g} & Y \\
            Z
        \end{tikzcd}  
        \]
    admits a colimit in $\dAnk$, denoted $Z'$. Moreover, the natural morphism
    $Z \to Z'$ is also a nil-embedding.
\end{prop}


\begin{proof} The \infcat of $\cTank$-structured \inftopos $\RTop(\cTank)$ is a presentable \infcat. Consider the pushout diagram
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            X \ar{r}{f} \ar{d}{g} & Y \\
            Z \ar{r} & Z',
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    in the \infcat $\RTop(\cTank)$. By construction, the underlying \inftopos of $Z'$ can be computed as the pushout in the \infcat $\RTop$ of
    the induced diagram on the underlying \inftopoi of $X$, $Z$ and $Y$. Moreover, since $g$ is a nil-isomorphism it induces an equivalence on underlying \inftopoi
    of both $X$ and $Y$. It follows that the induced morphism $Z \to Z'$ in $\RTop(\cTank)$ induces an equivalence on the underlying \inftopoi.
    Moreover, it follows essentially by construction that we have a natural equivalence
        \[
            \cO_{Z'} \simeq g_*(\cO_Y) \times_{g_*(\cO_Y)} \cO_Z \in \Str_{\cTank}\loc(Z).
        \]
    As effective epimorphisms are preserved under fiber products in an \inftopos, it follows that the natural morphism
        \[
            \cO_{Z'} \to \cO_Z,  
        \]
    is an effective epimorphism (since $g_*(\cO_Y) \to g_*(\cO_X)$ it is so).
    Consider now the commutative diagram of fiber sequences
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \cJ ' \ar{r} \ar{d} & \cO_{Z'} \ar{r} \ar{d}  & \cO_Z \ar{d} \\
            \cJ \ar{r} & g_*(\cO_Y) \ar{r} & g_*(\cO_X),
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    in the stable \infcat $\Mod_{\cO_Z'}$. Since the right commutative square is a pullback square it follows that the morphism
        \[
            \cJ' \to \cJ,  
        \]
    is an equivalence. In particular, $\pi_0(\cJ')$ is a finitely generated
    nilpotent ideal of $\pi_0(\cO\alg_{\cJ'})$. Indeed, finitely generation follows from our assumption that $g$ is a finite morphism.
    Thanks to \cref{lem:derived_k_analytic_space_whose_reduction_is_affinoid_is_also_affinoid},
    it follows that $\trunc(Z')$ is an ordinary $k$-analytic space and the morphism $\trunc(Z') \to \trunc(Z)$ is a nil-embedding. We are thus reduced to show that
    for every $i>0$, the homotopy sheaf $\pi_i(\cO_{Z'}) \in \Coh^+(\trunc(Z'))$. But this follows immediately from the existence of a fiber sequence
        \[
            \cO_{Z'} \to g_*(\cO_Y) \oplus \cO_Z \to g_*(\cO_X),  
        \]
    in the \infcat $\Mod_{\cO_{Z'}}$ together with the fact that $g_*(\cO_Y)$ and $g_*(\cO_Z)$ have coherent homotopy sheaves, by our assumption that $g$ is a
    finite morphism combined with \cref{lem:nil-isos_are_affine_morphisms}.
\end{proof}

\begin{defin} \label{defin:analytic_formal_moduli_problems_under}
    An \emph{analytic formal moduli problem under $X$} corresponds to the datum of a functor
        \[F \colon (\anNil_{X/})\op \to \cS,\]
    satisfying the following two conditions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $F(X) \simeq *$ in $\cS$;
        \item $F \simeq \mathbf{res}^{< \infty} \circ F$, where $\mathbf{res}^{< \infty}_!$ denotes the right Kan extension along the natural inclusion
        \item Given any pushout diagram
            \[\begin{tikzcd}
                S \ar{r}{f} \ar{d} & S' \ar{d} \\
                T \ar{r} & T',
            \end{tikzcd}\]
        in $\anNil_{X/}$ for which $f$ is has the structure of a square zero extension, the induced morphism
            \[F(T') \to F(T) \times_{F(S)}F(S),\]
        is an equivalence in $\cS$.
    \end{enumerate}
    We shall denote by $\anFMP_{X/}$ the full subcategory of $\Fun((\anNil_{X/ })\op, \cS)$ spanned by analytic formal moduli problems
    under $X$.
\end{defin}

\begin{construction}
We have a composite diagram
    \[
        h \colon \anNil_{X/} \to \dAnk \hookrightarrow \anPreStk.
    \]
Therefore, given any analytic pre-stack regarded as a limit-preserving functor $F \colon \anPreStk\op \to \cS$, one can consider its restriction to the \infcat
$\anNil_{X/}$:
    \[
        F \circ h \colon \anNil_{X/} \op \to \cS.      
    \]
We have thus a natural restriction functor
    \[
        h_* \colon \anPreStk \to \Fun(\anNil_{X/} \op, \cS).  
    \]
\end{construction}


\begin{eg}
    Let $X \in \dAnk$. As in the algebraic case, we can consider the \emph{de Rham pre-stack associated to $X$}, $X_\mathrm{dR} \colon \dAfd_k\op \to \cS$,
    determined by the formula
        \[
            X_{\mathrm{dR}}(Z) \coloneqq X(Z_\red), \quad Z \in \dAfd_k.  
        \]
    We have a natural morphism $X \to X_\mathrm{dR}$ induced from the natural morphism $Z_\red \to Z$.
    We claim that $h_*(X_\mathrm{dR}) \in \Fun(\anNil_{X/}\op, \cS)$ belongs to the full subcategory $\anFMP_{X/}$. Indeed, in this case it is clear that
    $h_*(X_\red)$ is the final object in $\anFMP_{X/}$ which clearly satisfies conditions i) and ii) in \cref{defin:analytic_formal_moduli_problems_under}.
\end{eg}

\begin{notation}
    We set $\anNil_{X/}^\cl \subseteq \anNil_{X/}$ to be the full subcategory spanned by those objects corresponding to nil-embeddings of the form
        \[
            X \to S,  
        \]
    in $\dAnk$.
\end{notation}

\begin{prop} \label{prop:analytic_FMP_under_X_are_ind_inf_schemes}
    Let $Y \in \anNil_{X/}$. The following assertions hold:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Then the inclusion functor
            \[
              \anNil^{\cl}_{X//Y} \hookrightarrow \anNil_{X//Y} , 
            \]
        is cofinal.
        \item The natural morphism
            \[
               \colim_{Z \in \anNil_{X//Y}^\cl} Z \to Y,  
            \]
        is an equivalence in $\Fun((\anNil_{X//Y})\op, \cS)$.
        \item The \infcat $\anNil_{X//Y}^\cl$ is filtered.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    We start by proving claim (i). Consider the usual restriction along the natural morphism $X_\red \to X$ functor 
        \[\mathbf{res} \colon \anNil_{X/} \to \anNil_{X_\red/}.\]
    Such functor admits a well defined left adjoint
        \[\mathbf{push} \colon \anNil_{X_\red/} \to \anNil_{X/},\]
    which is determined by the formula
        \[
            (X_\red \to T) \in \anNil_{X_\red /} \mapsto (X \to T') \in \anNil_{X/},   
        \]
    where we set
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:set_definition_of_T'_as_pushout_of_T_along_the_inclusion_X_red_to_X}
            T' \coloneqq X \bigsqcup_{X_\red} T \in \anNil_{X/}.  
        \end{equation}
    We claim that $T' \in \anNil_{X/}$ belongs to the full subcategory $\anNil^\cl_{X/} \subseteq \anNil_{X/}$.
    Indeed, since the structural morphism
        $X_\red \to T$,
    is necessarily a nil-embedding we deduce that the claim follows readily from \cref{prop:existence_of_pushouts_along_closed_nil-isomorphisms}.
    We shall denote
        \[
            \mathbf{res}_!(Y) \colon \anNil\op_{X_\red /} \to \cS,
        \]
    the left Kan extension of $Y$ along the functor $\mathbf{res}$ above. By the colimit formula
    for left Kan extensions, c.f. \cite[Lemma 4.3.2.13]{HTT}, it follows that $\mathbf{res}_!(Y)$ is given by the formula
        \[
            (X_\red \to T) \in  \anNil_{X_\red /} \mapsto Y(T') \in \cS,
        \]
    where $T'$ is as in \eqref{eq:set_definition_of_T'_as_pushout_of_T_along_the_inclusion_X_red_to_X}.
    Let $g \colon X_\red \to T$ in $\anNil_{X_\red/}$ and assume that $g$ factors through the natural morphism $X_\red \to X$. Then we have a natural morphism
        \[
           i_{T, *} \colon Y(T) \to \mathbf{res}_!(Y)(T) ,  
        \]
    in $\cS$, which exhibits the former as a retract of the latter. Denote by
        \[
            p_{T, *} \colon \mathbf{res}_!(Y)(T) \to Y(T),  
        \]
    be a right inverse to $i_{S, *}$. Consider the functor
        \[
            \mathbf{res}_Y \colon \anNil_{X//Y} \to \anNil_{X_\red / /\mathbf{res}_!(Y)},  
        \]
    given by the formula
        \[
            (X \to S \to Y) \in \anNil_{X//Y} \mapsto (X_\red \to S \xrightarrow{f} \mathbf{res}_!(Y)),  
        \]
    where $f \colon S \to \mathbf{res}_!(Y)$ corresponds to the morphism
        \[  
            S_X \xrightarrow{p_S} S \to Y,
        \]
    where $S_X \coloneqq X \bigsqcup_{X_\red} S$. We claim that the functor $\mathbf{res}_Y$ is a right adjoint to the functor
        \[
            \mathbf{push}_Y \colon \anNil_{X_\red // \mathbf{res}_!(Y)} \to \anNil_{X//Y},  
        \]
    the latter given by the formula
        \[
            (X_\red \to T \to \mathbf{res}_!(Y)) \in \anNil_{X_\red // \mathbf{res}_!(Y)} \mapsto (X \to T_X \to Y)  \in \anNil_{X//Y}.
        \]
    Indeed, the datum of a morphism
        \[
            (X_\red \to T \to \mathbf{res}_!(Y)) \to \mathbf{res}_Y(X \to S \to Y),  
        \]
    in $\anNil_{X_\red / \mathbf{res}_!(Y)}$ corresponds to the datum of a commutative diagram
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
          X_\red \ar{r} \ar{d} & T \ar{r} \ar{d} & \mathbf{res}_!(Y) \ar{d}{=} \\
          X_\red \ar{r} & S \ar{r} & \mathbf{res}_!(Y),  
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    where the right bottom morphism corresponds to the composite $S_X \to S \to Y$. For this reason, the given datum is equivalent to a commutative diagram
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            X_\red \ar{r} \ar{d} & T \ar{r} &  T_X \ar{r} \ar{rd} \ar{d}  & Y \ar{rd}{=} \\
            X_\red \ar{r} & S \ar{r} &  S_X \ar{r} & S \ar{r} & Y,
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    which on the other hand is equivalent to the datum of a commutative diagram
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            X \ar{r} \ar{d}{=} & T_X \ar{r} \ar{d} & Y \ar{d}{=} \\
            X \ar{r} & S \ar{r} & Y
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    The previous observations combined together then imply that we have a well defined adjunction
        \[
            \mathbf{res} \colon \anNil_{X/ /Y} \rightleftarrows \anNil_{X_\red // \mathbf{res}_!(Y)} \colon \mathrm{push}.
        \]
    We thus conclude that $\anNil_{X//Y} \to \anNil_{X_\red // \mathbf{res}_!(Y)}$ is a cofinal functor (as it admits a left adjoint). Claim (i) now follows
    immediately from the observation that the functor
        \[
            \mathrm{push} \colon \anNil_{X_\red / \mathbf{res}_!(Y)} \to \anNil_{X//Y},  
        \]
    factors through the natural inclusion $\anNil_{X//Y}^\cl \to \anNil_{X//Y}$.
    Claim (ii) follows immediately from (i) combined with Yoneda Lemma. To prove (iii) we shall make use of \cite[Lemma 5.3.1.12]{HTT}. Let
        \[
            F \colon \partial \Delta^n \to \anNil^\cl_{X//Y}.  
        \]
    For each $[m] \in \Delta^{n}$, denote by $S_m \coloneqq F([m]) $ in $\anNil^\cl_{X//Y}$. We then have that the pushout
        \[
            S_n \bigsqcup_X S_{n-1},  
        \]
    exists in $\anNil^\cl_{X/}$. We wish to show that $S_n \bigsqcup_X S_n$ admits a morphism
        \[S_n \bigsqcup_X S_{n-1} \to Y,\]
    compatible with the diagram $F$. In order to show this, we can filter the diagram $F$ by diagrams $F_i \to F$ such that $X \to F_0$ is formed by square-zero
    extensions and so are each $F_i \to F_{i+1}$. Moreover, by the fact that $Y$ satisfies condition (ii) in \cref{defin:analytic_formal_moduli_problems_under}
    it follows that we can find a well defined morphism
        \[
            S_n \bigsqcup_X S_{n-1} \to Y,  
        \]
    which is compatible with $F$, as desired.
\end{proof}


\begin{construction}\label{const:anFMP_as_ind_inf_schemes} Let $X \in \dAnk$. Consider the natural functor
    \[
        F \colon \anNil_{X/} \op \to \dAnk \op.
    \]
Left Kan extension along $F$ induces a functor
    \[
        F_! \colon \Fun( \anNil_{X/ }\op, \cS) \to \Fun  (\dAnk\op, \cS),
    \]
and thus an induced functor
    \[
        F_! \colon \anFMP_{X/} \to \Fun(\dAnk\op, \cS),
    \]
as well. We denote the latter \infcat by $\anPreStk_k$, the \infcat
of \emph{$k$-analytic pre-stacks}. \cref{prop:analytic_FMP_under_X_are_ind_inf_schemes} implies that the functor $F_!$ preserves filtered colimits.
In particular, if we regard $Y$ as a $k$-analytic prestack can be presented
as an \emph{ind}-\emph{inf}-object in the \infcat $\dAnk$, i.e., it can be written as a filtered colimit of nil-embeddings $X \to Z$.
We refer the reader to \cite{Gaitsgory_Study_II} for a precise meaning
of the latter notion in the algebraic setting.
\end{construction}



\begin{defin}
    Let $Y \in \anFMP_{X/}$ denote an analytic formal moduli problem under $X$. The \emph{relative pro-analytic cotangent complex of $Y$ under $X$} is defined as the pro-object
        \[
            \bbL\an_{X/Y} \coloneqq \{ \bbL\an_{X/Z} \}_{Z \in \anNil^\cl_{X//Y}}  \in \pro(\Coh^+(X)),
        \]
    where, for each $Z \in \anNil^\cl_{X//Y}$
        \[\bbL\an_{X/Z} \in \Coh^+(X),\]
    denotes the usual analytic cotangent complex associated to
    the structural morphism $X \to Z$ in $\anNil^\cl_{X//Y}$.
\end{defin}




\begin{rem}
    Let $Y \in \anFMP_{X/}$. Let $Z \in \dAnk$, there exists a natural morphism
        \[
            \bbL\an_X \to \bbL\an_{X/Z} ,  
        \]
    in $\Coh^+(X)$. Passing to the limit over $Z \in \anNil^\cl_{X//Z}$, we obtain a natural map
        \[
            \bbL\an_X \to \bbL\an_{X/Y},  
        \]
    in $\pro(\Coh^+(X))$, as well.
\end{rem}

The following result provides justifies our choice of terminology for the object $\bbL\an_{X/Y} \in \pro(\Coh^+(X))$:

\begin{lem} \label{lem:pro_cot_complex_classifies_nil_extensions_for_analytic_moduli_problems}
    Let $Y \in \anFMP_{X/}$. Let $X \hookrightarrow S$ be a square zero extension associated to an analytic derivation
        \[
            d \colon \bbL\an_S \to \cF ,  
        \]
    where $\cF \in \Coh^+(X)^{\ge 0}$. Then there exists a natural morphism
        \[
            \Map_{\anFMP_{X/}}(S, Y) \to \Map_{\pro(\Coh^+(X))}(\bbL\an_{X/Y}, \cF) \times_{\Map_{\Coh^+(X)}(\bbL\an, \cF)} \{ d \}
        \]
    which is furthermore an equivalence in the \infcat $\cS$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Thanks to \cref{prop:analytic_FMP_under_X_are_ind_inf_schemes} we can identify the space of liftings of the map $X \to Y$ along $X \to S$ with the mapping space
        \[
            \Map_{\anFMP_{X/}}(S, Y) \simeq \colim_{Z \in \anNil_{X//Y}} \Map_{\anNil_{X/}} (S, Z).  
        \]
    Fix $Z \in \anNil_{X//Y}$. Then we have a natural identification of mapping spaces
        \begin{align} \label{eq:identification_of_universal_property_of_rel_an_cotagent_complex}
            \Map_{\anNil_{X/}} (S, Z) & \simeq \Map_{(\dAnk)_{X/}} (S, Z) \\
                                      & \simeq \Map_{\Coh^+(X)}(\bbL\an_{X/Z}, \cF) \times_{\Map_{\Coh^+(X)}(\bbL\an_X, \cF)} \{ d \},
        \end{align}
    see \cite[\S 5.4]{Porta_Yu_Representability} for a justification of the latter assertion.
    Passing to the colimit over $Z \in \anNil_{X//Y}^\cl$, we conclude that
        \[
            \Map_{\anFMP_{X/}}(S, Y) \simeq \Map_{\pro(\Coh^+(X))}(\bbL\an_{X/Y}, \cF) \times_{\Map_{\Coh^+(X)}(\bbL\an, \cF)} \{ d \},
        \]
    as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{construction} \label{rem:morphisms_of_AnFMP_induce_transition_morphisms_on_relative_analytic_cot_complexes}
    Let $f \colon Y \to Z$ denote a morphism in $\anFMP_{X/}$. Then, for every $S \in \anNil_{X//Y}^\cl$ the induced morphism
        \[
            S \to Z,   
        \]
    in $\anFMP_{X/}$ factors through some $S' \in \anNil^\cl_{X/Z}$. For this reason, we obtain a natural morphism
        \[
            \bbL\an_{X/S'} \to \bbL\an_{X/S},  
        \]
    in the \infcat $\Coh^+(X)$. Passing to the limit over $S \in \anNil^\cl_{X//Y}$ we obtain a canonically defined morphism
        \[
            \theta (f) \colon \bbL\an_{X/Z} \to \bbL\an_{X/Y},  
        \]
    in $\pro(\Coh^+(X))$.
\end{construction}

\begin{prop}
    Let $f \colon Y \to Z$ be a morphism in the \infcat $\anFMP_{X/}$. Suppose that $f$ induces an equivalence of relative pro-analytic cotangent complexes via
    \cref{rem:morphisms_of_AnFMP_induce_transition_morphisms_on_relative_analytic_cot_complexes}.
    Then $f$ is itself an equivalence of analytic formal moduli problems under $X$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Thanks to \cref{prop:analytic_FMP_under_X_are_ind_inf_schemes} we are reduced to show that given any
        \[
            S \in \anNil_{X//Z}^\cl,  
        \]
    the structural morphism $g_S \colon X \to S$ admits a unique extension $S \to Y$ which factors the structural morphism $X \to Y$. Thanks to
    \cref{prop:filtered_colimit_for_nil-embeddings} we can reduce ourselves to the case where $X \to S$ has the structure of
    a square zero extension. In this case, the result follows from \cref{lem:pro_cot_complex_classifies_nil_extensions_for_analytic_moduli_problems}
    combined with our hypothesis.
\end{proof}

\begin{defin}
    Let $Y \in \anPreStk$, we shall say that $Y$ is \emph{infinitesimally cartesian} if it satisfies \cite[Definition 7.3]{Porta_Yu_Representability}.
\end{defin}

\begin{prop} \label{prop:sufficient_conditions_for_a_prestack_to_be_equiv_to_an_analytic_FMP}
    Let $Y \in \anPreStk_{X/}^{< \infty}$. Assume further that $Y$ is infinitesimally cartesian and it admits a relative pro-cotangent complex, $\bbL_{X/Y}\an \in \pro(\Coh^+(X))$.
    Then $Y$ is equivalent to an analytic formal moduli problem under $X$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    We must prove that given a pushout diagram
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            S \ar{r}{f} \ar{d}{g} & S' \ar{d} \\
            T \ar{r} & T'  
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    in the \infcat $\anNil_{X/}$, where $f$ has the structure of a square-zero extension, then the natural morphism
        \[
            Y(T') \to Y(T) \times_{Y(S)} Y(S'),  
        \]
    is an equivalence in the \infcat $\cS$. Suppose further that $S \hookrightarrow S'$ is associated to some derivation
    $d \colon \bbL\an_S \to \cF$ for some $\cF \in \Coh^+(S)^{\ge 0}$.
    Thanks to \cref{lem:pushouts_of_square_zero_extensions_have_the_structure_of_a_square_zero_extension} we deduce
    that the induced morphism $T \to T'$ admits a structure of a square-zero extension.
    Then, by our assumptions of $Y$ being infinitesimally cartesian and admitting a relative pro-cotangent complex, we have a chain of natural equivalences of the form.
        \begin{align*}
            Y(T') & \simeq \bigsqcup_{f \colon T \to Y} \Map_{T/ } (T', Y) \\
                  & \simeq \bigsqcup_{ f \colon T \to Y} \Map_{\pro(\Coh^+(T))_{ \bbL\an_Z / }}(\bbL\an_{T/Y}, g_*(\cF)) \\
                  & \simeq \bigsqcup_{f \colon T \to Y} \Map_{\pro(\Coh^+(S))_{g^* \bbL\an_T / }} (g^*\bbL\an_{T/Y}, \cF) \\
                  & \simeq \bigsqcup_{f \colon T \to Y } \Map_{\pro(\Coh^+(S))_{\bbL\an_S/}} (\bbL\an_{S, Y}, \cF) \\
                  & \simeq \bigsqcup_{f \colon T \to Y} \Map_{S/ }(S', Y) \\
                  & \simeq Y(T) \times_{Y(S)} Y(S'),
        \end{align*}
    where the third equivalence follows from the existence of a commutative diagram between fiber sequences
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}    
            g^* f^*\bbL\an_Y \ar{r} \ar{d}{=} & g^* \bbL\an_{T} \ar{r} \ar{d} &  g^* \bbL\an_{T/Y} \ar{d} \\
            (f\circ g)^*\bbL\an_Y \ar{r} & \bbL\an_{S} \ar{r} & \bbL\an_{S/Y},
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    in the \infcat $\pro(\Coh^+(S))$ combined with the fact that the derivation $d_T \colon \bbL\an_T \to g_*(\cF)$ is induced from
        \[
            d \colon \bbL\an_S \to \cF,
        \]
    as in the proof of \cref{lem:pushouts_of_square_zero_extensions_have_the_structure_of_a_square_zero_extension}. The result now follows.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Analytic formal moduli problems over a base}
Let $X \in \dAnk$ denote a derived $k$-analytic space. In \cite[Definition 6.11]{Porta_Yu_NQK}
the authors introduced the \infcat of \emph{analytic formal moduli problems over $X$}, which we shall denote by $\anFMP_{/X}$.

\begin{notation}
    Let $X \in \dAnk$. We shall denote by $\anNil_{/X}$ the full subcategory of $(\dAnk)_{/X}$ spanned by nil-isomorphisms
        \[
            Z \to X.  
        \]
\end{notation}

\begin{defin}
    We shall denote by $\anNil_{/X}^\cl \subseteq \anNil_{/X}$ the faithful subcategory in which we only allow morphisms
        \[
            S \to S'  
        \]
    in $\anNil_{/X}$ which are closed nil-isomorphisms.
\end{defin}

We start with the analogue of \cref{prop:analytic_FMP_under_X_are_ind_inf_schemes} in the setting of analytic formal moduli problems over $X$:

\begin{prop} \label{prop:required_conditions_for_formal_moduli_problems}
    Let $Y \in \anFMP_{/X}$. The following assertions hold:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The inclusion functor
            \[
                (\anNil^{\cl}_{/X})_{/Y}  \to (\anNil^{\cl}_{/X})_{/Y},
            \]
        is cofinal.
        \item The natural morphism
            \[
                \colim_{Z \in (\anNil^\cl_{/X})_{/Y}}  Z \to Y,
            \]
        is an equivalence in the \infcat $\anFMP_{/X}$.
        \item The \infcat $\anNil_{/X}^\cl$ is filtered.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    We first prove assertion (i). Let $S \to Z$ be a morphism in $(\anNil^\cl_{/X})_{/Y}$. Consider the pushout diagram
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:diagram_pushout_of_nil_isomorphisms_with_ltv_being_the_reduced_subspace}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            S_\red \ar{r} \ar{d} & S \ar{d} \\
            Z \ar{r} & Z',
        \end{tikzcd}
        \end{equation}
    in the \infcat $\anNil_{/X}$ whose existence is guaranteed by \cref{prop:existence_of_pushouts_along_closed_nil-isomorphisms}. Since
    the upper horizontal morphism in \eqref{eq:diagram_pushout_of_nil_isomorphisms_with_ltv_being_the_reduced_subspace} is a closed nil-isomorphism, we can reduce
    ourselves to the case where the latter is an actual square-zero extension. Indeed, the latter assertion follows by
    arguing by induction combined with \cref{prop:filtered_colimit_for_nil-embeddings}.
    Since $Y$ is assumed to be an analytic formal moduli problem over $X$ we then deduce that the canonical morphism
        \begin{align*}
            Y(Z') & \to Y(Z) \times_{Y(S_\red)} Y(S) \\
            &\simeq Y(Z) \times Y(S),  
        \end{align*}
    is an equivalence (we implicitly used above the fact that $S_\red \simeq X_\red$). As a consequence the object $(Z' \to X)$ in $\anNil_{/X}$ admits an induced morphism
    $Z' \to Y$ making the required diagram commute.
    Thanks \cref{prop:existence_of_pushouts_along_closed_nil-isomorphisms} we deduce that both
    $S \to Z'$ and $Z \to Z'$ are closed nil-isomorphisms. Therefore, we can factor the diagram
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            S \ar{rr} \ar{rd} & & Z \ar{dl} \\
                &               Y       &  
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    via a closed nil-isomorphism $Z \to Z'$. We conclude that the inclusion functor $(\anNil^\cl_{/X})_{/Y} \to (\anNil_{/X})_{/Y}$ is cofinal.
    It is clear that assertion (ii) follows immediately from (i). We now prove (iii). Let 
        \[\theta \colon K \to (\anNil^\cl_{/X})_{/Y},\]
    be a functor where
    $K$ is a finite \infcat. We must show that $\theta$ can be extended to a functor
        \[\theta^{\rhd} \colon K^{\rhd} \to (\anNil^\cl_{/X})_{/Y}.\]
    Thanks to \cref{prop:filtered_colimit_for_nil-embeddings} we are allowed to reduce ourselves to the case where morphisms indexed by $K$
    are square-zero extensions. The result now follows from the fact that $Y$ being an analytic moduli problem sends finite colimits along square-zero extensions
    to finite limits.
\end{proof}

Just as in the previous section we deduce that every analytic formal moduli problem over $X$ admits the structure of an \emph{ind}-\emph{inf}-object
in $\anPreStk_k$:

\begin{cor} \label{cor:formal_moduli_problems_over_X_are_ind_inf_objects}
    Let $Y \in (\anPreStk_k)_{/X}$. Then $Y$ is equivalent to an analytic formal moduli problem over $X$ if and only if there exists
    a presentation $Y \colim_{i \in I} Z_i$, where $I$ is a filtered \infcat and for every $i \to j$ in $I$, the induced morphism
        \[
          Z_i \to Z_j,  
        \]
    is a closed embedding of derived $k$-affinoid spaces that are nil-isomorphic to $X$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
    It follows immediately from \cref{prop:required_conditions_for_formal_moduli_problems} (ii).
\end{proof}

\begin{defin}
    Let $Y \in \anFMP_{/X}$. We define the \infcat of \emph{coherent modules on $Y$}, denoted $\Coh^+(Y)$, as the limit
        \[
            \Coh^+(Y) \coloneqq \lim_{Z \in (\dAnk)_{/Y}}  \Coh^+(Z),
        \]
    computed in the \infcat $\Catst$. We define the \infcat of \emph{pro-coherent modules on $Y$}, denoted $\pro(\Coh^+(Y))$, as
        \[
            \pro(\Coh^+(Y)) \coloneqq \lim_{Z \in (\dAnk)_{/Y}} \pro(\Coh^+(Z)),  
        \]
    where the limit is computed in the \infcat $\Catst$.
\end{defin}

\begin{defin} Let $Y \in \anFMP_{/X}$, $Z \in \dAfd_k$ and let $\cF \in \Coh^+(Z)^{\ge 0}$. Suppose furthermore that we are given a morphism $f \colon Z \to Y$.
    We define the \emph{tangent space of $Y$ at $f$ twisted by $\cF$} as the fiber
        \[
            \bbT\an_{Y, Z, \cF,f} \coloneqq \mathrm{fib}_f\big( Y(Z[\cF]) \to Y(Z) \big) 
            \in \cS.  
        \]
    Whenever the morphism $f$ is clear from the context, we shall drop the subscript $f$ above and denote the tangent space of $Y$ at $f$ simply by $\bbT\an_{Y, Z, \cF}$.
\end{defin}


\begin{rem} Let $Y \in \anFMP_{/X}$.
    The equivalence of ind-objects
        \[
            Y \simeq \colim_{S \in (\anNil^\cl_{/X})_{/Y}} S,
        \]
    in the \infcat $\dAnk$, implies that, for any $Z \in \dAfd_k$, one has an equivalence of mapping spaces
        \[
            \Map_{\anPreStk}(Z, Y) \simeq \colim_{S \in (\anNil^\cl_{/X})_{/Y}}  \Map_{\anPreStk}(Z,S ).
        \]
    For this reason, given any morphism $f \colon Z \to Y$ and any
    $\cF \in \Coh^+(Z)^{\ge 0}$, we can identify the tangent space $\bbT\an_{Y, Z, \cF}$
    with the filtered colimit of spaces
        \begin{align} \label{eq:description_of_cotangent_complex_of_a_formal_moduli_problem_in_terms_of_its_tangent_space}
            \bbT\an_{Y, Z, \cF} & \simeq \colim_{S \in (\anNil^\cl_{/X})_{Z/ /Y}} \fib_f \big( S(Z[\cF]) \to S(Z) \big) \\
                                & \simeq \colim_{S \in (\anNil^\cl_{/X})_{Z/ /Y}} \bbT\an_{S, Z , \cF } \\
                                & \simeq \colim_{S \in (\anNil^\cl_{/X})_{Z/ /Y}} \Map_{\Coh^+(Z)} (f_{S,Z}^* (\bbL\an_S), \cF),
        \end{align}
    where we have denoted by $f_{S, Z} \colon Z \to S$ any morphism, in $(\dAnk)_{/X}$, factoring $f \colon Z \to Y$.
    Moreover, the latter equivalence follows readily from \cite[Lemma 7.7]{Porta_Yu_Representability}. Therefore, we deduce that
    the analytic formal moduli problem
    $Y \in \anFMP_{/X}$ admits an \emph{absolute pro-cotangent complex} given as
        \[
           \bbL\an_Y \coloneqq \{ f^*_{S,Z}( \bbL\an_S )  \}_{Z \in (\dAnk)_{/Y}, S \in (\anNil^\cl_{/X})_{/Y}} \in \pro(\Coh^+(Y)).
        \]
\end{rem}   

\begin{cor}
    Let $Y \in \anFMP_{/X}$. Then its absolute cotangent complex $\bbL\an_Y$ classifies analytic deformations on $Y$. More precisely, given $Z \to Y$ a morphism
    where $Z \in \dAfd_k$ and $\cF \in \Coh^+(Z)^{\ge 0}$ one has a natural equivalence of mapping spaces
        \[
            \bbT\an_{Y, Z, \cF} \simeq \Map_{\pro(\Coh^+(Y))}(\bbL\an_Y, \cF).  
        \]
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
    It follows immediately from the natural equivalences displayed in \eqref{eq:description_of_cotangent_complex_of_a_formal_moduli_problem_in_terms_of_its_tangent_space}
    combined with the description of mapping spaces in \infcats of pro-objects.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Non-archimedean nil-descent for almost perfect complexes}
In this \S, we prove that the \infcat $\Coh^+(X)$, for $X \in \dAnk$ satisfies nil-descent with respect to morphims $Y \to X$, which exhibit
the former as an analytic formal moduli problem over $X$.

\begin{prop} \label{prop:nil_descent_for_Coh^+}
    Let $f \colon Y \to X$, where $X \in \dAnk$ and $Y \in \anFMP_{/X}$. Consider the \v{C}ech nerve
    $Y^\bullet \colon \mathbf \Delta \op \to \anPreStk$ associated to $f$.
    Then the natural functor
        \[
            f_\bullet^* \colon \Coh^+(X) \to \mathrm{Tot}(\Coh^+(Y^\bullet)),  
        \]
    is an equivalence of \infcats.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Consider the natural equivalence of $k$-analytic prestacks
        \[
            Y \simeq \colim_{Z \in (\anNil^\cl_{/X})_{/Y}}  Z.
        \]
    Then, by definition one has a natural equivalence
        \[
            \Coh^+(Y) \simeq \lim_{Z \in (\anNil^\cl_{/X})_{/Y}} \Coh^+(Z),  
        \]
    of \infcats. In particular, since totalizations commute with cofiltered limits in $\Catinf$, it follows that we can suppose from
    the beginning that $Y \simeq Z$ for some $Z \in \anNil_{/X}$. In this case, the morphism $f \colon Y \to X$ is affine. In particular, the fact that
    $\Coh^+(-)$ satisfies Zariski descent combined with \cref{lem:affine_morphisms_are_compatible_with_Zariski_localization_on_the_base} we further reduce ourselves
    to the case where we might assume both $X$ and $Y$ to be both equivalent to derived $k$-affinoid spaces. In this case, by Tate acyclicity
    theorem it follows that letting $A \coloneqq \Gamma(X, \cO_X \alg)$ and $B \coloneqq \Gamma(Y, \cO_Y\alg)$ the pullback functor $f^*$ can be identified with
    the base change functor
        \[
            \Coh^+(A) \to \Coh^+(B).  
        \]
    In this case, it follows that $B$ is nil-isomophic to $A$. Moreover, since the latter are derived noetherian rings
    the statement of the proposition follows due to \cite[Theorem 3.3.1]{preygel_Leistner_Mapping_stacks_properness}.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
    Let $X \in \dAnk$ and $f \colon Y \to X$ a morphism in $\anPreStk$ which exhibits $Y$ as an analytic formal moduli problem over $X$.
    Then the natural functor 
        \[
            f_\bullet^* \colon \pro(\Coh^+ (X)) \to \mathrm{Tot}(\pro(\Coh^+(Y^\bullet/X))),
        \]
    is an equivalence of \infcats, where $Y^\bullet$ denotes the \v{C}ech nerve of the morphism $f$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
    By the very definition of the \infcat $\pro(\Coh^+(Y))$, we reduce ourselves as in
    \cref{prop:nil_descent_for_Coh^+} to the case where $Y = S$, for some $S \in \anNil_{/X}$. In this case, it follows readily from
    \cref{prop:nil_descent_for_Coh^+} that the natural functor
        \[
            f_\bullet^* \colon \pro(\Coh^+(X)) \to \mathrm{Tot}(\pro(\Coh^+(Y^\bullet/X))),  
        \]
    is fully faithful. \cref{lem:f^*_admits_a_right_adjoint_whenever_f_is_nil-iso} that we have a well defined right adjoint
        \[
            f_* \colon \Coh^+(S) \to \Coh^+(X),  
        \]
    to the usual pullback functor $f^* \colon \Coh^+(X) \to \Coh^+(S)$. We can extend the right adjoint $f_*$ to a well defined functor
        \[
            f_* \colon \pro(\Coh^+(S)) \to \pro(\Coh^+(X)),  
        \]
    which commutes with cofiltered limits. For this reason, we have a well defined functor
        \[
            \lim_{[n] \in \bDelta \op} f_{\bullet, *} \colon \mathrm{Tot}(\pro(\Coh^+(Y^\bullet/X))) \to \pro(\Coh^+(X)),  
        \]
    which further commutes with filtered limits. We claim that $\lim_{[n] \in \bDelta \op} f_{\bullet, *}$ is a right adjoint to $f_\bullet^*$ above. Indeed, given
    any $\{ \cF_i \}_{i \in I\op}  \in \pro(\Coh^+(X))$ and $\{ \cG_{j, [n]} \}_{j \in J_{[n]} \op, [n] \in \bDelta \op} \in \mathrm{Tot}(\pro(\Coh^+(Y^\bullet/X)))$,
    we compute
        \begin{align*}
            \Map_{\mathrm{Tot}(\pro(\Coh^+(Y^\bullet/X)))}( f_\bullet^*( \{ \cF_i \}_{i \in I\op}), \{ \cG_{j, [n]} \}_{j \in J\op_{[n]}, [n] \in \bDelta \op}) & \simeq \lim_{[n] \in \bDelta \op} \Map_{\pro(\Coh^+(Y^{[n]}))} ( \{f_{[n]}^\bullet(\cF_i) \}_{i \in I\op},  \{ \cG_{i, [n]} \}_{i \in I\op_{[n]}, [n]}) \\
            \lim_{[n] \in \bDelta \op} \lim_{j \in J\op_{[n]}} \mathrm{colim}_{i \in I} \Map_{\Coh^+(Y^{[n]})} ( f_{[n]}^\bullet(\cF_i),   \cG_{i, [n]}) & \simeq \lim_{[n] \in \bDelta \op} \lim_{j \in J\op_{[n]}} \colim_{i \in I} \Map_{\Coh^+(X)} (\cF_i, f_{[n], *}(\cG_{i, [n]})) \\
            \lim_{[n] \in \bDelta \op} \Map_{\pro(\Coh^+(X))}( \{\cF_i\}_{i \in I\op}, \{f_{[n], *}(\cG_{i, [n]}) \}_{i \in I_{[n]} \op}) & \simeq \Map_{\pro(\Coh^+(X))}( \{\cF_i\}_{i \in I\op}, \lim_{[n] \in \bDelta \op} \{f_{[n], *}(\cG_{i, [n]}) \}_{i \in I_{[n]} \op}),
        \end{align*}
    as desired. In order to conclude, we will show that the functor
        \[
            \lim_{[n] \in \bDelta \op} f_{\bullet, *} \colon \pro(\Coh^+(X)) \to \mathrm{Tot}(\pro(\Coh^+(Y^\bullet/X))),  
        \]
    is conservative. Since both the \infcats $\mathrm{Tot}(\pro(\Coh^+(X)))$ and $\mathrm{Tot}(\pro(\Coh^+(Y^\bullet/X)))$ are stable, we are reduced to prove that given any
        \[
            \{ \cG_{i, [n]} \}_{i \in I\op, [n]} \in \mathrm{Tot}(\pro(\Coh^+(Y^\bullet/X))),  
        \]

\subsection{Non-archimedean formal groupoids}
Let $X \in \dAfd_k$ denote a derived $k$-affinoid space. We denote by
$\mathrm{AnFGrpd}(X)$ the full subcategory of the \infcat of simplicial objects
    \[
        \Fun( \bDelta \op, \anFMP_{/X}),
    \]
spanned by those objects $F \colon \mathbf \Delta \op \to \anFMP_{/X}$ satisfiying the following requirements:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $F([0]) \simeq X$ ;
        \item For each $n \ge 1$, the morphism
            \[
                F([n]) \to F([1]) \times_{F([0])} \dots \times_{F([0])} F([1])  ,
            \]
        induced by the morphisms $s^i \colon [1] \to [n]$ given by $(0,1) \mapsto (i, i+1)$, is an equivalence
        in $\anFMP_{/X}$.
    \end{enumerate}
\todo{Put the above as a definition + introduce analytic formal moduli problems over.}

\begin{lem} \label{formal_moduli_under_induce_formal_moduli_over_via_base_change}
    Let $X \in \dAnk$. Given any $Y \in \anFMP_{X/ }$, then for each $i= 0, 1$ the $i$-th projection morphism
        \[
            p_0 \colon X \times_Y X \to X,  
        \]
    computed in the \infcat $\anPreStk_k$ lies in the essential image of $\anFMP_{/X}$ via \cref{const:anFMP_as_ind_inf_schemes}.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Consider the pullback diagram
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            X \times_Y X \ar{r}{p_1} \ar{d}{p_0} & X \ar{d} \\
            X \ar{r} & Y ,
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    computed in the \infcat $\anPreStk$. Thanks to \cref{prop:analytic_FMP_under_X_are_ind_inf_schemes} together with the fact that fiber products commute with filtered colimis in the \infcat $\anPreStk_k$,
    we deduce that
        \[
            X \times_Y X \simeq \colim_{Z \in \anNil^\cl_{X//Y}} X \times_Z X, 
        \]
    in $\anPreStk_k$. It is clear that $(p_i \colon X \times_Z X \to X)$ lies in the essential image of $ \anFMP_{/X}$, for $i = 0, 1$. Thus also the filtered colimit
        \[
            (p_i \colon X \times_Y X ) \in \anFMP_{/X}, \quad \mathrm{for \ } i = 0, 1,
        \]  
    as desired.
\end{proof}


\begin{construction} Thanks to \cref{formal_moduli_under_induce_formal_moduli_over_via_base_change},
there exists a well defined functor $\Phi \colon \anFMP_{X/} \to \anFGrpd(X)$ given by the formula
    \[
        (X \to Y ) \in \anFMP_{X/ } \mapsto Y^\wedge_X \in \anFGrpd(X),
    \]
where $Y^\wedge_X \in \anFGrpd(X)$ denotes the analytic formal groupoid over $X$ whose presentation is given by
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      \dots \ar[r, shift left=2] \ar[r, shift left=0.75] 
      \ar[r, shift left=-0.75] \ar[r, shift left=-2]
      & X \times_Y X \times_Y X \ar[r, shift left=-1] \ar[r, shift left=1] \ar[r] 
      & X \times_Y X \ar[r, shift left=-0.25ex] \ar[r, shift left=0.25ex] 
      & X 
    \end{tikzcd}.
    \] 
Moreover, given any $\cG \in \anFGrpd(X)$, we can associate it an analytic formal moduli problem under $X$,
denoted $\rB_{X}(\cG)$, as follows: let $X \to S$ be an object
in $\anNil_{X/}$, then we let
    \[
        \rB_{X}(\cG) (S) \coloneqq  \big\{ (\tS \to S) \in \anFMP_{/S}, \tS \to X, \mathrm{a \ morphism \ of \ groupoid \ objects \ }\tS \times_S \tS \to \cG \mathrm{ \ satisfying \  (*) 
        } \big\}
    \]
where condition (*) is determined by requiring that the commutative squares
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \tS \times_S \tS \ar{r} \ar{d}{p_i} & \cG \ar{d}{p_i} \\
        \tS \ar{r}   & X
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
for $i=0, 1$ are cartesian. Such association is functorial in $(X \to S) \in \anNil_{X/}$ and thus it defines a well defined functor
    \[
        \rB_{X}(\cG) \colon \anNil_{X/ }\op \to \cS.  
    \]
\end{construction}

\begin{rem}
    Let $X \in \dAnk$ and $\cG \in \anFGrpd(X)$. There exists a canonical morphism $X \to \rB_X(\cG)$ given by associating every 
        \[
            Z \in \dAfd_k
        \]
\end{rem}

\begin{lem}
    The functor $\rB_X(\cG) \colon \anNil_{X/}\op \to \cS$ is equivalent to an analytic formal moduli problem.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Thanks to \cref{prop:sufficient_conditions_for_a_prestack_to_be_equiv_to_an_analytic_FMP} it suffices to prove that $\rB_X(\cG)$ is
    infinitesimally cartesian and it admits furthermore a pro-cotagent complex. Infinitesimally cartesian follows from the modular description
    of $\rB_X(\cG)$ combined with the fact that $\cG$ is infinitesimally cartesian, as well. We are thus required to show that $\rB_X(\cG)$ admits
    a \emph{global} pro-cotangent complex. 
\end{proof}
